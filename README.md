# narrow-down-agents
Narrowed down to 50 from almost 2000 employee with given data. Made the method, metrics, wrangling, weigh, etc. by myself and select those 50.

Given some dataset such as
- Education, Occupation, and Nationality
- Joining Date
- Birth Date
- Payout Record

Long short story, all i did was:
  1. **Clean** and fix errors on date format (DAX and M)
  2. Doing so-called "**Data Wrangling**" to create:
      - Age column
      - Duration as an employee
      - Payout Per Month
      - Total Payout Per Angent
      - Rank of Duration, Payout per Month (PpM), and Total Payout
<br/>.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
. . . . . Finally we can select top 50 from 2000.
